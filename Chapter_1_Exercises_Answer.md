# Chapter 1 Exercises Answers
## 1. How would you define Machine Learning?
- **Machine Learning** is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- For more specific information, A computer program is said to learn from experience _**E**_ with respect to some task _**T**_
and some performance measure _**P**_, if its performance on _**T**_, as measured by _**P**_, improves
with experience _**E**_.

## 2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
- Four types of problems where it shines:-
    * Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
    * Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
    * Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data. 
    * Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

## 3. What is a labeled training set?
- **Labeled training set** is a set of training data which has the expected
output each instance comes with it.

## 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
- Two most common supervised tasks are **Classification** and **Regression**.

## 5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
- Four common unsupervised tasks are:-
    - Clustering
        - K-Means
        - DBSCAN
        - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
    - Anomaly detection and novelty detection
        - One-class SVM
        - Isolation Forest
    - Visualization and dimensionality reduction
        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Kernel PCA
        - Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
        - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    - Association rule learning
        - Apriori
